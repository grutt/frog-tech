## Company Challenge by Frog Design for Cornell Tech
Company Challenge:
How might we use wearables and/or sensors to enhance a design researcher's ability to draw more
valuable insights while in the field?

Objectives:
As a product design firm ourselves, we are constantly trying to improve our processes and tools to excel
at making products. We believe that user research is an essential part of any human-centered design
program - it is core to what we do and we want to do it better. In designing a solution to our ask,
students will gain a deeper understanding of qualitative research, human behavior, and the design
process as a whole. Students will be asked to explore a number of technical domains, for instance,
computer vision, physical computing, AI, NLP, sentiment analysis, and human-computer interaction. As
part of this engagement, we can also offer students a chance to learn how we do product design.
